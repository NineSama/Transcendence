# Transcendence

Can use nginx, but not necessary.

If backend  -> must be written in pure Ruby
Frontend    -> pure vanilla Javascript

## Single-page application
            -> dynamically update the content without reloading the entire page
            -> HTML + Javascript + CSS
            -> API calls to the server, for data transfers
            -> Faster performance, but longer load for first instance
